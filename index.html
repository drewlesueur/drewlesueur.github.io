<h1>Drew's Software Learnings</h1>
<p>By Drew LeSueur <a href="https://twitter.com/drewlesueur">@drewlesueur</a></p>
<p>This site is for documenting the things I've learned as a computer programmer working on teams to create software for people.</p>
<p>Below is a list of concepts or technologies and my thoughts on them.</p>
<hr>
<a name="enduservalue"><h2>End-User Value</h2></a>
<p>
    The best software is used by people and it helps them.
    <br>
    It works!
    <br>
    It's extremely satisfying to create something useful.
    <br>
    I enjoy working with the end-user or a good representative of end-user to create software.
</p>
<hr>
<a name="teams"><h2>Teams</h2></a>
    <p>
    I love working with a team when creating software.
    <br>
    I love helping and learning from a team.
    <br>
    I have learned so much from my teammates.
    <br>
    I value diversity and inclusion.

<a name=problemsolving><h2>Problem Solving</h2></a>
<p>
    Software development is all about problem solving.
    <br>
    A good software developer is a good problem solver.
    <br>
    I think skill in a specific language or technology is not as important as general problem-solving skills.
    <br>
    Languages and technologies can be learned if it's required to solve a problem.
    <br>
    I like when there is a simple solution to a problem and many times there is.
</p>
<hr>
<a name="simplicity"><h2>Simplicity</h2></a>
    <p>
    Simplicity is one of the most important considerations when writing code. Simple code has fewer bugs, is more secure, is easier to change and remove later.
    <br>
    Simple code is easy to read and understand&mdash;code you can fit in your head.
    <br>
    Not everything can be simple, and there are tradeoffs that require more complex code, but as much as reasonable, I prefer simple code.
    <br>
    In general, I think of simple code is code that has few levels of indirection, fewer nodes in a diagram, and generally linear.
    <br>
    What can I remove?
    </p>

<a name="releasing"><h2>Releasing</h2></a>
    <p>
    Web-based software has the benefit (and drawback) of being able to be changed frequently.
    <br>
    It allows software developers to release software in small increments.
    <br> 
    Users can get incremental benefit along the way.
    <br>
    Without the drive to release, I've seen software projects spin forever in development mode.
    <br>
    What's the most important thing we can work on in order to release quickly?
    </p>
<hr>
<a name="overhead"><h2>Overhead</h2></a>
<p>
    It's natural for me to love coding,
    <br>
    and not spend as much time on other important things related to software.
    <br>
    Make time for other tasks like Code Maintenance, Testing, Documentation, and Production Monitoring
</p>
<hr>
<a name="codemaintenance"><h2>Code Mainentance</h2></a>
<p>
    Code and systems develop organically over time.
    <br>
    Things are added, changed, removed.
    <br>
    After time, artifacts of change exist that are unintended, but natural.
    <br>
    Your code could have left-over parts that aren't used.
    <br>
    Or your system could be too complex.
    <br>
    It's important to take time to analyze code and systems, and identify ways to clean and simpify it.
    <br>
    It's much easier to do this when there are tests, especially integration-style tests.
</p>

<a name=bugs><h2>Bugs</h2></a>
<a name=abstraction><h2>Abstraciton</h2></a>
<p>
    I follow the idea that code is read much more that it is written.
    <br>
    Code should be able to be removed and edited easily.
    <br>
    There is beauty and simplicity in abstraction in general,
    <br>
    but sometimes the cost of learning or remembering
    the abstraction is not worth the duplication that the abstraction removes.
    <br>
    I will sometimes duplicate code if I think it will make it clearer and easier to understand and change later.
    <br>
    When a heavy abstraction is beneficial, I like providing an "abstraction escape-hatch" so you can break out of the abstraction when needed.
</p>

    <blockquote><i><a href="https://go-proverbs.github.io/">A little copying is better than a little dependency.</a></i></blockquote>

<a name=tradeoffs><h2>Tradeoffs</h2></a>
    <p>
        I love the idea of tradeoffs. Two opposing decisions might both be right, as long as the deciders are happy with the tradeoffs involved.
        <br>
        Many decisions come down to personal preference. I don't believe that there is always one universal, correct way to solve a problem.
        <br> 
        I've really enjoyed seeing "best practices" change over the years. It reminds me that I should have confidence in the tradeoff decisions I have made,
        <br>
        but also respect others for their decisions.
        <br>
        If you are making software, and you have a simple solution that works, don't feel bad if it seems to go against "best practices"
