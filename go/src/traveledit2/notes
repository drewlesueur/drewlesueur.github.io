make a find in files feature!!!
it should open a new pane with all the files
that you can scroll through and open


swiping up after selecting sometimes causes keyboard
to appear but it shouldn't

touching after selecting should copy
or just selecting should copy

tap to choose word needs work
eliminate need to double tap
seems buggy what char position 0

ability to make a new file or directory

real terminal emulator (use tmux?)
in bash mode, allow for clicking on files to change directory there

------------

when you are editing, any cursoor change in the canvas
should affect the cursor change in the input element

add gzip

a local storage save, just in case

need to add file explorer,
allow nee directory


do shortcuts like
zfn func () { ...
zer if err != nil
zpr ()
zcr {}
zbr []
zpq ("")
zps ('')
ztg <>
zct </>


select in left margin selects lines

single tap - edit mode
double tap - selects word
triple tap - selects next most outer grouping (using quotes, parens, brackets, etc.
(you can get slightly smart and handle wscaped quotes.

tab in
tab  out

tap then tap drag selects 

move line down
move line up


remember where you were when you toggle the log
select within a single line
preserve vertical space
handle undefined lines!!

a little slider keyboard on the bottom!!
a little slider wordboard on the bottom

move cursor back to top when done deleting

selecting should select the text box too
paste from outside source (more than 1 line)

ui and flow of not going past the end of the file
right side will be a word selector based on all the words 

when something is selected when you
paste, it needs to delete that.
you need a command line component.
you maybe dont need full terminal emulation
but a way to run commands

need to support multibyte chars like emojis.
you'll need to make the chars an array too
that will take more time but doable.

it saved an empty file!
This was when I was driving to payson and working on it
I did get js alerts about network issues
but weird that it would have saved an empty file
Maybe I need to send a hash of the file too.
or at least content length.
todo: ability to turn off auto save
todo: add a formal save button
todo: offline mode
todo: a way to copy the text out? 

when you keep tapping in insert mode it toggles
the word. gets closest words. up down up down.
maybe it deletes the word first?

re-visit last word feature? good idea. too heavy

more gestures, fewer buttons?
after selecting - you could hit a letter?
or gesture
after selecting -
* up - cut
* left - dedent
* right - indent
* down - copy
* single tap - unselect
* upright - comment
* upleft uncomment

when navigating cursor - tapping in left margin
makes a new line - actually what if it pasted
and two finger tap is a new line
nah, but then you can't paste inside a line
2 touch paste should be good.


long press in margin for selecting whole lines

swipe all the way left twice does search

second finger selects
margin selects whole line

keyboard shortcuts for for loops functions
you type replacement text like zfn zfor

when cursor is at word:
* single tap on bottom right of screen:
  search down for that word
* single tap on bottom left of screen:
  first time delete, the subsequent toggles
* single tap in big moddle area: edit
* single tap too right: search up


larger todo: have a more sophisticated undo and redo.
undo? move cursor back and forth
redo?


5 margin positions
paste copy cut duplicate newline


pasting sub lines not working so well?

three finger paste not working

while in edit mode
* if tap while cursor is at end of word -- autocomplete
* if tap while cursor is inside word -- find close words
* if tap while cursor is at start, delete?
* if tap while cursor is in space, find close words

don't render so much. use some sort of requestanimationframe 
vertical select is tap twice when one finger is already down


halt
